Twitter Sentiment Analysis:

This repository contains a data file with tweets pulled from Twitter. The data file is in CSV format and includes a column named "OriginalTweet" that contains the text data. The purpose of this project is to perform text preprocessing on the text data in the "OriginalTweet" column and analyze the word frequencies using word clouds.

The following steps were performed on the data file:
The text corpus in the "OriginalTweet" column was converted into tokens using the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.
Stop words were removed from the tokens to eliminate words that are common and do not carry significant meaning in the context of the text data.
Word frequencies were counted to identify the most frequently occurring words in the text data.
Word clouds were generated to visualize the most frequently occurring words in the text data.
